##Description
This is a prototype of a web application that collects and presents facial expressions of anyone who visits the page.

###Development
Start by running `npm i` to install dependencies.
When developing, the raw files are found in the `./src/` directory, then Gulp minifies the JS and HTML and compiles the LESS into the `./build/` folder.

###Assets
Images should be stored in the `./build/assets/` folder
